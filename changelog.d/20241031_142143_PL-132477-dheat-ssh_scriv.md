<!--

A new changelog entry.

Delete placeholder items that do not apply. Empty sections will be removed
automatically during release.

Leave the XX.XX as is: this is a placeholder and will be automatically filled
correctly during the release and helps when backporting over multiple platform
branches.

### Impact

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for non-production machines

### NixOS XX.XX platform

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for non-production machines. (PL-132477)
  This may have impact if you have multiple unauthenticated SSH connections in a short time.
  We will roll out this change to production VMs too if no problems occur.
