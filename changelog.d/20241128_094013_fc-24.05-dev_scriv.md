A new changelog entry.

Delete placeholder items that do not apply. Empty sections will be removed
automatically during release.

Leave the XX.XX as is: this is a placeholder and will be automatically filled
correctly during the release and helps when backporting over multiple platform
branches.

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for all machines as protection against SSH DHeat attacks. (PL-132477)
  This may have impact if you have multiple unauthenticated SSH connections in a short time.
  We tested this change on non-production machines over the last 3 weeks and got no reports of problems.
