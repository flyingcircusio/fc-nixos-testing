### Impact

- None.

### NixOS XX.XX platform

- The `fc-postgresql` command now supports upgrades of databases with preinstalled extensions:
  - When upgrading manually with `fc-postgresql`, add `--extension-names ext1 --extension-names ext2` to the command line. `ext1`/`ext2` must be the package names of the extensions without the `postgresqlPackages.`-prefix. Usually it's the packages in [`services.postgresql.extraPlugins`](https://search.flyingcircus.io/search/options?q=services.postgresql.extraPlugins&channel=fc-24.05-dev#services.postgresql.extraPlugins).
  - When using automatic upgrades ([`flyingcircus.services.postgresql.autoUpgrade.enable `](https://search.flyingcircus.io/search/options?q=+flyingcircus.services.postgresql.autoUpgrade.enable+&channel=fc-24.11-dev&page=1#flyingcircus.services.postgresql.autoUpgrade.enable)), existing extensions will be discovered automatically. You don't have to do anything in this case.
