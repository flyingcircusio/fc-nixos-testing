# Release 2024_031

## Impact

- NFS clients will be rebooted to activate the new configuration. This happens
  as a side effect of a kernel update. In the future changes to NFS client
  settings will cause explicit reboot requests.

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for non-production machines

- Machines will schedule a maintenance reboot to activate the new kernel.

## NixOS XX.XX platform

- Make NFS clients more resilient against missing servers during bootstrap,
  upgrades, and reboot scenarios. (PL-133062)

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for non-production machines. (PL-132477)
  This may have impact if you have multiple unauthenticated SSH connections in a short time.
  We will roll out this change to production VMs too if no problems occur.

- Explain how to use the the new release metadata URLs in DevHosts. (FC-41601)

- varnish: Fix syntax error handling during hot reloads. We silently did
  not fail on errors which masked issues until the next reboot causing
  varnish to then fail e.g. during scheduled maintenance. We now fail
  more visibly but keep running the old config, still. (FC-41403)
