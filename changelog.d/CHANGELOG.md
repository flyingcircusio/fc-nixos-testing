## Impact

- None.

## NixOS XX.XX platform

- Internal: Introduce automatic nixpkgs update workflow (PL-133100)

- The `fc-postgresql` command now supports upgrades of databases with preinstalled extensions:
  - When upgrading manually with `fc-postgresql`, add `--extension-names ext1 --extension-names ext2` to the command line. `ext1`/`ext2` must be the package names of the extensions without the `postgresqlPackages.`-prefix. Usually it's the packages in [`services.postgresql.extraPlugins`](https://search.flyingcircus.io/search/options?q=services.postgresql.extraPlugins&channel=fc-24.05-dev#services.postgresql.extraPlugins).
  - When using automatic upgrades ([`flyingcircus.services.postgresql.autoUpgrade.enable `](https://search.flyingcircus.io/search/options?q=+flyingcircus.services.postgresql.autoUpgrade.enable+&channel=fc-24.11-dev&page=1#flyingcircus.services.postgresql.autoUpgrade.enable)), existing extensions will be discovered automatically. You don't have to do anything in this case.

- Fix a bug in the reload script for the varnish service that only occurs when there are cold VCLs to be discarded. An error in the templating would lead to attempting to run a varnish admin instruction (vcl.discard in this case) as a shell command. (PL-133251)

- Update nixpkgs from e8368806d2c792603b4c47afe0e3709a51d232a2 to ebcc9ab51d9d5495508eb5c520eb188aecd7f799

# Release 2024_034

## Impact

- There is a small but non-zero potential that some clients may experience connectivity issues with nginx.
  Multiple connectivity testing tools showed no change for clients and/or libraries but cannot cover every single implementation out there.

- services using an updated package will be restarted

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for production machines.

## NixOS XX.XX platform

- agent: fix merging cold boot activities into warm reboots. We noticed maintenance requests that have been postponed multiple times on some machines, causing repeated maintenance notification mails. (PL-133180).

- Increase SSL validation check timeout to better distinguish DNS resolution
  errors and other causes of timeouts. (PL-133125)

- Restrict a class of key agreement protocols, called Diffie-Hellman Elliptic Curves, enabled in Nginx to mitigate a DoS attack vector
  described in CVE-2024-41996. The curves for ECDHE ciphers are then restricted to x25519, secp256r1, and x448.

- Update the mailserver role documentation with an example nix configuration

- Fix permissions for some platform logic that creates a `.erlang.cookie` for rabbitmq which would previously cause a failure when starting the service.
  The problem was caused due to insufficient write permissions when attempting to write the cookie after rabbitmq's first startup.
  During first startup, rabbimq generates a random cookie, writes it to the appropriate file and sets that file to be read-only.

- Scheduled rotation of CS' root ssh key

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for all machines as protection against SSH DHeat attacks. (PL-132477)
  This may have impact if you have multiple unauthenticated SSH connections in a short time.
  We tested this change on non-production machines over the last 3 weeks and got no reports of problems.


# Release 2024_031

## Impact

- NFS clients will be rebooted to activate the new configuration. This happens
  as a side effect of a kernel update. In the future changes to NFS client
  settings will cause explicit reboot requests.

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for non-production machines

- Machines will schedule a maintenance reboot to activate the new kernel.

## NixOS XX.XX platform

- Make NFS clients more resilient against missing servers during bootstrap,
  upgrades, and reboot scenarios. (PL-133062)

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for non-production machines. (PL-132477)
  This may have impact if you have multiple unauthenticated SSH connections in a short time.
  We will roll out this change to production VMs too if no problems occur.

- Explain how to use the the new release metadata URLs in DevHosts. (FC-41601)

- varnish: Fix syntax error handling during hot reloads. We silently did
  not fail on errors which masked issues until the next reboot causing
  varnish to then fail e.g. during scheduled maintenance. We now fail
  more visibly but keep running the old config, still. (FC-41403)

- Pull upstream NixOS changes, security fixes and package updates:
    - chromium: 129.0.6668.100 -> 130.0.6723.69 (CVE-2024-10229, CVE-2024-10230, CVE-2024-10231)
